# <p align="center">Introduction </p>

Seems like an essential to have a personal site when seeking employment, especially if it is your first role as you need something to showcase you are not just bluffing your CV. It has been through a few alterations but I've tried to keep it clean and simple and not overdo it and try to show off.

### <p align="center">React

Highly popular for a reason and no need to reinvent the wheel here.

### <p align="center">Chakra UI

My preferred UI library, allows me to build fast and provided useful easy to use functionality such as the drawer function on the projects.

### <p align="center">Framer Motion

The default way to add simple animations into your site. I think the trick is to not overdo it and animate every element, I just wanted a few simple animations to just keep the UI engaging.

### <p align="center">SASS

Only to provide the animated background on the landing screen.

### <p align="center">React Query

My preferred way to fetch and cache data, I use this for fetching my blog posts for display.
